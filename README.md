# Hi there! 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer based in Tokyo with 7+ years of experience, specializing in frontend development with modern JavaScript frameworks and Flutter.

## 🚀 What I Do

I love building quality software products with clean, scalable code. I work best in collaborative teams where we support each other and aim to create meaningful impact.

**What I work with:**
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Flutter — Creating smooth, fast user interfaces
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python — Building reliable APIs and server solutions
- **Mobile**: Flutter (iOS/Android) — Making apps that work great on any device
- **Desktop**: Electron — Developing powerful desktop applications

I've delivered products across web, mobile, and desktop platforms — from single-page apps to mobile-first solutions. I'm motivated by building products that reach people around the world and make their lives better.
