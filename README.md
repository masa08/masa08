# Hi there! 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer based in Tokyo with 7+ years of experience, specializing in frontend development with modern JavaScript frameworks and Flutter.

## 🚀 What I Do

I enjoy building software that is not only technically solid, but also genuinely useful to people in the real world. I care deeply about writing clean, robust, and scalable code that can grow with both the product and the business.

**What I work with:**
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Flutter — Creating smooth, fast user interfaces
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python — Building reliable APIs and server solutions
- **Mobile**: Flutter (iOS/Android) — Making apps that work great on any device
- **Desktop**: Electron — Developing powerful desktop applications

I thrive in collaborative environments where team members openly share ideas, support one another, and work toward clear outcomes. Delivering results as a team—and seeing our work make a meaningful impact—is what motivates me most as an engineer.
